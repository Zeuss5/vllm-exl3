# cuda-exl3

EXL3 ([ExLlamaV3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3) trellis quantization)
support for vLLM, with custom CUDA kernels tuned for continuous batching.

```bash
pip install -e .            # needs torch + nvcc; builds cuda_exl3._C
vllm serve TelperionAI/Qwen3.8-27B-EXL3-5.5bpw
```

vLLM picks the plugin up through the `vllm.general_plugins` entry point, so
`quant_method: "exl3"` checkpoints just load. CUDA graphs and `torch.compile`
work; nothing to configure.

## Why custom kernels

ExLlamaV3's GEMM fixes `TILESIZE_M` at 16 and loops over the batch in 16-row
chunks, re-reading the entire trellis for each chunk. That is close to optimal
for single-stream decode, and it is what the format was designed around. But it
makes cost linear in batch size: on an RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell the kernel sits at
~1.65 TB/s -- exactly HBM speed -- from m=24 upward, because it is re-reading
weights, not computing. A 512-row batch reads a 47 MB tensor 32 times.

Continuous batching lives precisely in that range. So this kernel tiles M: a
block owns `BM` rows x `BN` columns and the *whole* k extent, reads its slice of
the trellis **once**, and amortizes the dequant across all `BM` rows. Owning the
full k extent also means the block holds a complete output row segment, so the
output Hadamard and `svh` scaling fold into the epilogue -- no second pass, and
no `k x n` fp16 scratch buffer.

## One op per layer

`torch.ops.cuda_exl3_C.exl3_linear` does a whole quantized linear in one call:

* **Activation transform, fused.** `had(x * suh)` for every shard in a single
  launch, reading `x` once. bf16 -> fp16 conversion happens in the same load, so
  there are no separate `.to()` kernels -- those were ~10% of decode GPU time.
* **All shards in one GEMM.** Fused layers (`qkv_proj`, `gate_up_proj`,
  Qwen3.5's `in_proj_qkvz`) are one launch. Only the activation slice differs per
  shard; trellis, `svh` and the output are addressed by absolute column, so a
  block just looks up which shard its column range belongs to.
* **Epilogue emits the caller's dtype** directly, bf16 or fp16.
* **Registered through `torch.library`**, not raw pybind, so Dynamo can trace it.
  A bare pybind function is opaque to Dynamo and blocks vLLM's CUDA graph
  capture outright. Being functional (it allocates and returns its output) also
  makes the fake/meta implementation trivial, and lets inductor fuse around it --
  it ends up merged with the surrounding RMSNorm.

Two further departures from upstream:

* **The input transform is a separate kernel.** ExLlamaV3 fuses it into the front
  of its GEMM and pays with a cooperative launch (a grid-wide sync between
  transform and matmul). Splitting it costs one extra pass over the activations
  -- a few microseconds, since `x` is small and L2-resident -- and in exchange
  the GEMM is an ordinary kernel: no cooperative launch, no grid size tied to the
  SM count, nothing special under graph capture.

* **Split-k for narrow layers and small batches.** `down_proj` is only 40 blocks
  wide at `BN=128`, leaving most of a 188-SM GPU idle. Splitting k adds blocks
  without multiplying how often `A` is re-read (shrinking `BN` would). Partials
  go to an fp32 accumulator via coalesced atomics; the epilogue Hadamard consumes
  them and re-zeroes the buffer, so no per-call memset is needed. The split
  factor is capped so accumulator traffic stays under ~30% of the weight bytes it
  is trying to stream faster.

## Measured

RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (188 SMs), measured roofline **1520 GB/s** HBM read and
**400 TFLOPS** fp16 dense. An EXL3 matmul reads `k*n*bits/8` bytes and does
`2*m*k*n` flops, so arithmetic intensity is `16m/bits` flop/byte: memory bound
below m~99 at 6 bits, compute bound above. Speed of light is the max of the two
limits. `bench/bench_gemm.py` reports achieved TFLOPS, GB/s and %SoL per shape.

Qwen3.5-27B 5.5bpw, 6-bit tensors, speedup vs `exllamav3_ext.exl3_gemm`:

| layer | m=16 | m=32 | m=64 | m=128 | m=256 | m=512 | m=2048 | m=8192 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `q_proj` 5120x12288 | 1.11x | 1.86x | 2.43x | 2.65x | 2.59x | 3.05x | 4.28x | 4.50x |
| `up_proj` 5120x17408 | 1.08x | 2.01x | 2.43x | 2.30x | 3.17x | 3.88x | 4.02x | 3.94x |
| `down_proj` 17408x5120 | 1.42x | 2.71x | 3.37x | 3.66x | 4.03x | 4.26x | 4.58x | 4.98x |

Faster at every batch size measured, and **101-128% of the roofline above** at
m=16-32. Over 100% is not an error: that roofline charges every weight byte to
HBM, and this GPU has a **128 MiB L2** -- a whole `q_proj` (47 MB) or `down_proj`
(67 MB) trellis fits in it, so part of the traffic never reaches memory. The
effective read rate at m=16 is ~1.9 TB/s against 1.52 TB/s of HBM. At m>=2048 the
compute bound binds instead, at 71-83% (330 TFLOPS peak).

### End to end (online serving)

`vllm serve` + `vllm bench serve`, 8k in / 1k out, bf16, no MTP, prefix caching
**disabled** and a distinct seed per run (with caching on and a fixed seed the
runs replay each other's prompts and "TTFT" becomes a cache lookup). Compared
against the same checkpoint on exllamav3 via TabbyAPI, same GPU.

Prefill, 8000-token prompt:

| engine | prefill tok/s |
|---|---|
| exllamav3 / TabbyAPI, 1 GPU | ~3,050 (engine-reported) |
| cuda-exl3, TP=1 | **4,816** (1.58x) |
| cuda-exl3, TP=4 | **7,674** (2.52x) |

Output token throughput, and per-token decode latency (TPOT):

| conc | exllamav3 1 GPU | cuda-exl3 TP=1 | cuda-exl3 TP=4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 25.3 tok/s (TPOT 17.9 ms) | 54.4 (16.8 ms) | 92.7 (9.8 ms) |
| 4 | 38.7 (30.3 ms) | 150.7 (21.9 ms) | 249.7 (13.5 ms) |
| 16 | did not complete | 307.3 (37.0 ms) | 504.1 (23.4 ms) |
| 64 | did not complete | 389.4 (108.1 ms) | 698.3 (59.6 ms) |

Two honest caveats. At concurrency 1 the two are close on decode latency (17.9 vs
16.8 ms/token) -- both are bandwidth-bound reading the same 16.5 GB of weights,
and this kernel is already at ~89% of that limit, so there is little left to win
there. And exllamav3's "did not complete" rows are requests timing out in the
benchmark client, not crashes: with 8k prompts its prefill is effectively
serialized across requests at ~3k tok/s, so 16 arrivals queue ~43 s before decode
starts. That is a scheduling difference (vLLM interleaves chunked prefill with
decode), not a statement about exllamav3's kernels.

Offline (short prompts, batch of identical requests), for reference:

**Known gap:** at m<=16 upstream is still marginally faster on two of three
shapes -- its dedicated GEMV path runs at ~90% of speed of light and is hard to
beat. That is single-stream decode; anything with real batching is past it.

## What profiling found

Profiling a batch-32 decode run (`bench/`-adjacent scripts in the repo history)
turned up three things, in order of size:

1. **Only 2.14s of a 7.39s run was GPU work.** Everything else was launch
   overhead, because the pybind entry point blocked CUDA graph capture. Fixing
   the registration and enabling graphs took the run to 2.34s.
2. **~10% of GPU time was elementwise dtype conversion** -- two extra passes over
   activations per linear. Folding the conversion into the Hadamard load/store
   and the epilogue removed it, along with ~44k kernel launches.
3. **50.2M shared-memory bank conflicts in the GEMM** (`ncu`). `ldmatrix` reads 8
   rows at one column offset; with a 64-byte A row those land on only 2 distinct
   bank groups, and no XOR swizzle can fix it because there are only 4 columns to
   permute. Padding the row stride to 80 bytes spreads them across 8 banks and
   cut conflicts 8.4x, to 6.0M.

A fourth came from the roofline rather than a counter: at small batch the kernel
is *dequant*-bound, not memory-bound, and with two warp rows each trellis tile
was being decoded twice. A 16-wide warp tile (one warp row) decodes each tile
exactly once and lifted m=16-32 from ~66% to 84-98% of speed of light.

## What is supported

**Bitrates and codebooks: all of them.** Every EXL3 bitrate (1-8 bits, which may
vary per tensor within one checkpoint) and all three procedural codebooks --
`3inst`, `mcg`, `mul1` -- are instantiated. The codebook multiplier is a constant
of the codebook id rather than per-tensor data, so the id is all the kernel
needs. Verified end-to-end on both a 5.5bpw checkpoint (bits {5,6,7}) and a
4.0bpw one (bits {4,6}).

**Models: dense architectures that vLLM already supports.** The plugin only
provides the EXL3 runtime -- it does not implement any model. Layers whose
tensors are not EXL3 in the checkpoint (norms, embeddings, an unquantized vision
tower) fall through to vLLM's normal paths untouched, so a multimodal model works
as long as its language model is the quantized part.

**Mixture-of-experts works.** Routed experts run as a grouped GEMM: vLLM's
`moe_align_block_size` sorts the (token, expert) pairs and pads each expert's run
to a whole row block, so every block belongs to one expert and the kernel just
offsets the trellis by a per-block expert id. Verified on Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (256
experts, top-8, 4-bit, `mcg` codebook), eager and under CUDA graphs.

The EXL3-specific part is that `suh` is per expert *and* per shard, and it lives
inside the input Hadamard -- so the activation transform has to happen after
routing. `exl3_moe_had_in` gathers each routed row and transforms it with its own
expert's scales in one pass.

One caveat:

* **Module-name resolution is heuristic.** vLLM's module paths do not always
  match the checkpoint's (Qwen3.5 is `model.language_model.layers.N` on disk but
  `language_model.model.layers.N` in vLLM), so names are matched exactly first
  and then with the `model`/`language_model` wrapper segments dropped. A model
  that renames layers more aggressively than that would need a mapping entry.
  `CUDA_EXL3_DEBUG_NAMES=1` logs what resolved and what did not.

## VRAM

Exactly what ExLlamaV3 stores: `trellis` (int16), `suh`/`svh` (fp16), bias. No
dequantized weights are ever materialized, and the activation and split-k
workspaces are process-wide rather than per layer. Qwen3.5-27B at 5.5bpw loads to
**18.89 GiB** of parameters against a 19.95 GiB checkpoint.

## Notes on the format

`suh` is one value per input channel, but it differs between the shards of a
fused layer: q/k/v (and gate/up) are quantized as separate tensors with
separately chosen input scales. Only the sign pattern is shared; the magnitudes
genuinely differ, and `suh` sits *inside* the Hadamard, so the shards cannot be
folded into a single vector. `trellis` and `svh` do concatenate along the output
dim (every shard of a fused group shares a bitrate), so a layer keeps one trellis
addressed by offset, plus one `suh` row per shard.

Slicing that trellis in Python would produce a non-contiguous view whose row
stride the kernel cannot recover -- hence the shard-map approach.

## Determinism

Split-k reduces with fp32 atomics, so results are reproducible in value but not
bit-exact run to run. `CUDA_EXL3_DETERMINISTIC=1` disables it: bit-exact
everywhere, slower for small batches and narrow layers.

## Environment variables

Every name also resolves under its old `VLLM_EXL3_` spelling, with a deprecation
warning.

Worth setting in a deployment:

| variable | meaning |
|---|---|
| `CUDA_EXL3_TUNE_CACHE` | directory for the persisted MLA tuner cache. Unset, every process re-tunes: ~11 shapes before a server is up and more as the batch size moves, tens of milliseconds each. Keyed by device name and format tag in the filename, appended lock-free, safe to share between ranks and across restarts |
| `CUDA_EXL3_BACKEND` | `native` (default), or `exllamav3` to run upstream's kernels as an oracle |
| `CUDA_EXL3_DETERMINISTIC` | `1` disables split-k for bit-exact output |
| `CUDA_EXL3_ONLINE_BITS` | bit rate for on-the-fly quantization of an unquantized checkpoint |
| `CUDA_EXL3_ONLINE_CACHE` | directory to keep the result of that, so it happens once |
| `CUDA_EXL3_DEBUG_NAMES` | log which modules resolve to EXL3 vs unquantized |
| `CUDA_EXL3_PACKED_MAPPING` | JSON of extra packed-module fusions, e.g. `{"gate_up_proj": ["gate_proj", "up_proj"], "in_proj_qkv": ["qkv_proj"]}`, for a fusion the model class does not declare. Every module in a group must be EXL3 in the checkpoint -- a group containing a bf16 tensor resolves nothing. Same effect as `packed_modules_mapping` in the checkpoint's quantization config, but applies to a published checkpoint you cannot edit |

Overrides for the autotuners. Each defaults to searching; setting one pins it,
which is mostly useful for bisecting a regression:

| variable | meaning |
|---|---|
| `CUDA_EXL3_MLA_TUNE` | `0` disables MLA decode tuning and takes the fallback shape |
| `CUDA_EXL3_MOE_BLOCK_M` | pin the MoE row-block size instead of using the ladder |
| `CUDA_EXL3_MOE_ACC_MAX_ELEMS` | cap on the MoE split-k accumulator; `0` forces the unsplit path |
| `CUDA_EXL3_FORCE_BM` | pin the dense GEMM's row-block size |
| `CUDA_EXL3_AUTOTUNE` | `0` disables the dense GEMM search |
| `CUDA_EXL3_SPLIT_TARGET`, `CUDA_EXL3_SPLIT_BUDGET` | split-k wave and accumulator targets |

Measurement knobs. These exist because comparing two *builds* produced most of
the wrong numbers in this project's history -- forcing both arms inside one
binary is the way to A/B a kernel change:

| variable | meaning |
|---|---|
| `CUDA_EXL3_MOE_SKIP_PAD` | `0`/`1` forces the MoE padding-row skip off or on |
| `CUDA_EXL3_MLA_TUNE_VERBOSE` | `1` logs each tune: shape, chosen chunk, ring size, cost |
| `CUDA_EXL3_MLA_TUNE_RING` | selection-ring size for the tuner's eviction model; `0` restores warm-cache timing |

## Tests

```bash
CUDA_EXL3_TEST_MODEL=/path/to/exl3-model pytest tests/ -v
```

Covers every BM tier, both epilogues, multi-shard equivalence, bf16 activations
and the split-k accumulator invariant, against a dense fp16 reference
reconstructed from the same trellis.

## MTP (speculative decoding)

```python
speculative_config={"method": "qwen3_5_mtp", "num_speculative_tokens": 1}
```

The checkpoint's MTP head is EXL3-quantized at 4 bits, but it is **missing from
`quantization_config.json`** -- so `Exl3Config` recovers any such module by
reading the safetensors headers (shape/dtype only, no tensor data). Offline
tok/s, no-MTP -> MTP: c=1 60.8 -> 93.6, c=4 216 -> 391, c=16 787 -> 1241,
c=64 1745 -> 1969. Biggest gains at low concurrency, where the GPU is idle
waiting on weights.

## Tensor parallel

Works unchanged: `tensor_parallel_size=4` shards the trellis, `suh` and `svh`
through the stock vLLM parameter path. Splitting the input dim stays exact
because the EXL3 input transform is a *block-diagonal* Hadamard over 128-element
blocks and every split dim here is 128-divisible; `svh` and the output Hadamard
are linear, so they commute with the all-reduce. Weights land at ~7 GiB/GPU.

### Pin the ranks to the GPUs' socket

Not a plugin setting, but it was worth 10% of TTFT here and it took four rounds
of chasing a phantom kernel regression to find, so it is written down.

These cards have no peer-to-peer: `cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer` is 0 for every pair,
so NCCL connects all four ranks `via SHM/direct` and every all-reduce byte goes
out to host memory and back. On a dual-socket host that makes socket placement
part of the collective's bandwidth, and the GPUs here report `numa_node = -1` --
the firmware never tags them -- so Linux puts NCCL's shared-memory buffers on
whichever socket the process happened to land on. Nothing in the NCCL log
differs between a good start and a bad one: same four channels, same ring, same
chunk size.

All-reduce, 8192 x 4096 bf16, three process starts each:

| placement       | run 1 | run 2 | run 3 |
|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|
| whatever Linux picks | 31.2 | 27.8 | 37.3 GB/s |
| pinned to the GPUs' socket | 37.3 | 37.3 | 37.3 |
| pinned to the far socket | 27.9 | 27.8 | 27.9 |

The all-reduce is 38% of the prefill budget (see *What prefill is bound by*), so
that 34% swing lands directly on TTFT. GLM-5.3-Flash, 8000 in / 1000 out, TP 4:

| placement | TTFT at 1 | TTFT at 16 | out tok/s at 16 |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| unpinned, 6 starts | 778-875 ms (12.5% spread) | 4607-5104 ms | 495-531 |
| pinned, 2 starts | 777-785 ms (1.1%) | 4590-4591 ms | 529-531 |

So pinning does not only raise the mean by ~6%, it removes the lottery: the
unpinned worst case is 11% off the pinned figure, and an unpinned A/B has ~12%
of noise in it, which is enough to invent a regression that is not there.

Find the socket the GPUs are on (`nvidia-smi topo -m` gives the CPU affinity
when the firmware provides it; otherwise measure it, as above) and pin both CPUs
and memory to it:

```bash
docker run --cpuset-cpus=0-29 --cpuset-mems=0 ...   # this host: socket 0
# or, without docker:
numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 vllm serve ...
```

A host with working GPU P2P, or a single-socket host, does not have this
problem.

### MoE throughput

Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (256 experts, top-8, 4-bit, `mcg`), one GPU, greedy decode:

| concurrency | tok/s | ms/token |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 204 | 4.91 |
| 4 | 661 | 6.05 |
| 8 | 1244 | 6.43 |
| 16 | 2252 | 7.11 |
| 32 | 3160 | 10.13 |
| 64 | 4611 | 13.88 |

At c=8 the decode is GPU-bound and splits roughly: **38% EXL3 GEMMs** (of which
the expert GEMMs proper are 16%), 8% gated-delta-net, 8% assorted elementwise,
8% an unquantized bf16 GEMM (the router), 6% vLLM's routing/alignment kernels,
5% the dense activation transform, 4% the split-k epilogue, 4% the MoE activation
transform, and 1.5% the combine.

Folding SwiGLU into the down-projection's input transform took a chunk out of
that elementwise slice. Online, 8k in / 1k out, prefix caching off, one GPU:

| | prefill (tok/s) | c=1 | c=8 | c=32 | c=64 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| before | 21,825 | 191.5 | 705.8 | 1141.5 | 1268.5 |
| after | 23,791 | 200.8 | 742.9 | 1211.6 | 1313.4 |
| | +9.0% | +4.9% | +5.3% | +6.1% | +3.5% |

(Decode columns are output tok/s. These are far below the short-prompt table
above because every request carries 8k of context.)

## Versus NVFP4

`unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` is the same base model, so it is a direct read on
where a trellis format stands against native FP4 tensor cores. One RTX PRO 6000
Blackwell each, 8k in / 1k out, prefix caching off, `--gpu-memory-utilization
0.9`, **FP8 KV cache on both sides**, NVFP4 on its fastest backend
(`--kernel-config '{"linear_backend":"flashinfer_b12x"}'`).

Two things have to be matched or the comparison is meaningless, and both default
in NVFP4's favour:

* Unsloth's checkpoint ships a `kv_cache_scheme`, so vLLM silently gives it an
  **FP8 KV cache** while EXL3 runs BF16 -- half the KV traffic per decode step.
* `linear_backend` `auto`/`cutlass` is not the fast path on SM120. `flashinfer_b12x`
  is worth ~18% on decode TPOT at c=1. (Plain `b12x` cannot load this checkpoint:
  its FP8 kernel wants static per-tensor activation scales, the checkpoint has
  dynamic per-token.)

End-to-end output tok/s -- every request pays an 8k prefill, so this folds
prefill and decode together:

| tok/s | NVFP4 (21.83 GiB) | EXL3 5.5bpw (19.98 GiB) | EXL3 4.0bpw (15.73 GiB) |
|---|---|---|---|
| prefill | **11,862** | 5,182 | 5,435 |
| c=1 | 56.1 | 56.6 | **67.6** |
| c=8 | **317.3** | 253.7 | 283.9 |
| c=32 | **645.9** | 408.2 | 438.0 |
| c=64 | **772.8** | 448.3 | 471.6 |

Decode alone (concurrency / mean TPOT), with prefill taken out:

| decode tok/s | NVFP4 | EXL3 5.5bpw | EXL3 4.0bpw |
|---|---|---|---|
| c=1 | 58.2 | 62.0 | **75.0** |
| c=8 | 358.6 | 320.9 | **365.5** |
| c=32 | **836.4** | 622.0 | 675.4 |
| c=64 | **1054.0** | 706.7 | 744.2 |

The crossover is the whole story, and it is exactly what the kernel analysis
predicts. At c=1-8 decode is weight-bandwidth-bound, the EXL3 GEMM is already at
the HBM roofline, and the format with fewer bits wins -- 4.0bpw is **22% faster
than NVFP4 at c=1** on a checkpoint 28% smaller. From c=32 up the batch is large
enough to be compute-bound, and there the trellis costs ~74 instructions per 8
weights to dequantize into bf16 mma while NVFP4 feeds FP4 tensor cores directly:
NVFP4 wins by 24% at c=32 and 42% at c=64. Prefill is the same effect at its
extreme -- **2.3x**.

### MoE: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B

`nvidia/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4` vs `UnstableLlama/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-exl3-4.00bpw`,
same harness. Neither checkpoint ships a `kv_cache_scheme`, so both ran BF16 KV
with nothing to match by hand. On SM120 the only NVFP4 MoE backends that load at
all are `auto` and `flashinfer_b12x` -- `flashinfer_cutedsl` and `cutlass` both
reject the scheme on this device.

| tok/s | NVFP4 b12x | NVFP4 auto | EXL3 4.00bpw |
|---|---|---|---|
| prefill | **34,316** | 30,038 | 24,394 |
| c=1 | 211.7 | **213.9** | 204.6 |
| c=8 | **799.1** | 777.5 | 746.5 |
| c=32 | **1390.4** | 1375.9 | 1185.3 |
| c=64 | **1674.7** | 1632.9 | 1424.0 |

Decode alone (concurrency / mean TPOT):

| decode tok/s | NVFP4 b12x | NVFP4 auto | EXL3 4.00bpw |
|---|---|---|---|
| c=1 | 221.2 | **225.2** | 218.3 |
| c=8 | **870.5** | 860.2 | 852.9 |
| c=32 | 1607.2 | **1636.8** | 1451.9 |
| c=64 | 2006.9 | **2017.0** | 1824.9 |

The gap is far smaller than on the dense model: EXL3 is within **3% at c=1** and
**2% at c=8** on decode, and 11-13% behind at c=32-64, against 2.3x on dense
prefill and 42% on dense decode at c=64. MoE decode streams one expert slice per
row-block and is weight-bound almost everywhere, which is the regime the trellis
is competitive in -- there is much less compute-bound headroom for FP4 tensor
cores to exploit. Prefill still favours NVFP4, but by 1.41x rather than 2.3x.

EXL3 also leaves considerably more room for context: 65.44 GiB of KV against
51.59 GiB at the same `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.9`, i.e. 2.56M vs 2.02M tokens
(**+27%**), from an 18.07 GiB checkpoint against 21.85 GiB. For MoE, `auto` is
already fine for decode; `flashinfer_b12x` is worth 14% on prefill.

So EXL3 is the better choice for local, low-concurrency serving on this hardware,
and NVFP4 for prefill-heavy or high-concurrency serving. Closing the compute-bound
gap needs a codebook that decodes into fp8/nvfp4 rather than bf16 -- a format
change, not a kernel change. Note these are speed numbers at different bit
budgets; no accuracy comparison was run.

## GLM-5.3-Flash

`brandonmusic/GLM-5.3-Flash-tr3-4bpw` is EXL3 in the ordinary sense -- 4-bit
`mcg`, `written_suffixes: [trellis, suh, svh, mcg]`, multiplier 0xCBAC1FED --
but it quantizes *only* the routed experts (`scope: glm53_routed_experts_only`),
leaving attention, the shared experts and the head in bf16. 45 layers, 288
experts, top-8, MLA with `qk_rope_head_dim: 0`.

The model definition is **not ours**: `Glm5Next*` is upstream Apache-2.0 vLLM
(shipping in a pre-release, not yet on PyPI). The sparse-MLA decode kernel and
its attention backend now are (see below); the measurements in this section
predate that backend and were taken against b12x. Stock vLLM cannot serve this model
on SM120 by any configuration: the sparse path wants `fp8_ds_mla` (which asserts
`pe_dim == 64`), and forcing dense MLA with `index_topk: null` then fails with
no MLA prefill backend for `(qk_nope 256, rope 0, v 256)`.

Measured on 4x RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, TP=4, `nvfp4_ds_mla` KV, pure decode
(TTFT excluded), 256 tokens on a code-agent prompt:

| | pure decode tok/s |
|---|---|
| ours, no speculation | 109.7 |
| **ours + MTP-5** | **214.7  (1.96x)** |

For scale, the published community numbers for this model on 2x RTX PRO 6000 at
a 400 W cap are 71.0 tok/s without speculation and 193-223 with a DFlash2 K5
drafter. Different GPU count, power budget and bitrate, so treat it as a sanity
check rather than a head-to-head.

Two measurement traps, both of which cost real time here: a random-token dataset
(`--dataset-name random`) destroys draft acceptance and makes speculation look
like a regression, and counting *stream chunks* rather than the server's token
count undercounts speculative decode by ~3x. Use a realistic prompt and
`stream_options: {include_usage: true}`.

## Sparse-MLA decode

`torch.ops.cuda_exl3_C.mla_decode` is a fused sparse-MLA decode kernel written
for SM120. MLA shares one latent row across every query head, so a decode step
reads `topk x head_dim` of cache no matter how many heads there are; that read
is the roofline and everything above it is the kernel's own overhead.

Both matmuls run on tensor cores, using nothing newer than `mma.m16n8k16` and
`cp.async` -- no wgmma, no TMA, no datacenter-only instruction -- so the same
source targets the RTX PRO 6000 and the DGX Spark.

* `S = Q @ K^T` is an mma with **m = 16 heads exactly** (GLM's head count at
  TP=4), and `row.col` wants B stored `[n][k] = [key][dim]`, which is already
  the cache layout. No transpose.
* `O += P @ V` is a second mma with the roles rotated -- m = dim, n = head,
  k = key -- so V comes out of shared through a transposing `ldmatrix` and P,
  produced `[head][key]`, is the B fragment as-is.
* Softmax runs once per tile rather than once per key. That is what makes the
  second mma possible (an accumulator can only be rescaled between mmas), and
  it drops the rescale count by a factor of the tile on its own.
* Q occupies `16 x KS` halves and a K tile occupies `TILE x KS`; at `TILE = 16`
  those are equal, so Q is staged into the second K buffer, read out into
  register fragments, and the buffer handed back to the pipeline. Double
  buffering costs no shared memory.
* The row stride is padded to `D + 8`. At the natural 576 halves the stride is
  288 words, a multiple of 32, which puts every `ldmatrix` on the same four
  banks; at 584 the rows step by four banks and each one covers all 32.
* The split size and block shape are autotuned per `(batch, heads, topk)` and
  cached, skipped during graph capture (`CUDA_EXL3_MLA_TUNE=0` to disable).

### Using it from vLLM

`cuda_exl3.attention.Exl3MLASparseBackend` wires the kernel into vLLM as a
sparse-MLA backend. vLLM's backends live in an enum that an out-of-tree package
cannot add to, but `CUSTOM` is reserved for this, so the plugin binds that slot
and you select it by name:

```
--attention-backend CUSTOM --kv-cache-dtype auto
```

Only the decode path is ours. Prefill, the top-k mask machinery and the metadata
builder are vLLM's `SparseMLACommonImpl` and `FlashInferMLASparseMetadataBuilder`,
untouched. Two differences from `FLASHINFER_MLA_SPARSE_SM120`:

* The cache stays **bf16 in its natural `(slot, head_size)` layout** rather than
  the packed 656-byte `fp8_ds_mla` record, so nothing is dequantised on the read
  path and no per-block scales are stored.
* `head_size` is whatever the model actually has. GLM's is 512; the kernels this
  replaces require 576 and must be fed 64 zero dims per key to get there.

It declines a quantised cache rather than silently misreading one, and it does
not return an LSE, so decode-context parallelism is not supported on this path.

What is verified: the kernel against an fp32 reference across head dims, head
counts, batch sizes and top-k widths; the backend's `forward_mqa` end to end
against a gather reference, driving vLLM's own Triton index conversion with a
shuffled block table and `-1` holes; and construction through the real base class
at GLM-5.3-Flash's exact attention dimensions. What is **not** verified is a
served model, because `Glm5Next*` is not in a released vLLM and the only build
that has it is inside the community Docker image.

### What prefill is bound by

**The interconnect, then the kernels.** This took two wrong answers to get
right, both from timing something unrepresentative, so the numbers below are all
measured on the path that actually runs.

For an 8000-token prefill at TP=4, against a measured TTFT of 779 ms:

| component | ms | % of TTFT | how it was measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TP all-reduce** | **294** | **38%** | NCCL, 90 all-reduces of 65.5 MB at a measured 21 GB/s |
| MoE GEMM | 154 | 20% | the fused `exl3_moe_gemm` path, 288 experts in one launch |
| sparse MLA attention | 149 | 19% | this kernel, at prefill shapes |
| attention projections | 64 | 8% | cuBLAS bf16 at the sharded shapes |
| indexer | 12 | 2% | projections plus causal scoring |
| **accounted** | **675** | **87%** | |

**This box has no NVLink.** A 4-GPU all-reduce runs at 21 GB/s and a 2-GPU one at
28.7; GLM does two per layer, so 90 of them at 65.5 MB each is 294 ms that no
kernel can touch. Dropping to TP=2 buys 1.37x on comms and pays double the
per-GPU compute, which is a net loss for TTFT. The `VLLM_ENABLE_PCIE_ALLREDUCE`
path the reference recipe uses does not engage at TP=4 -- it is gated to two
GPUs, which is presumably why that recipe runs TP=2 in the first place.

**The MoE GEMM is hardware-bound at block 128**, and this was checked rather
than assumed. Profiling the fused kernel at GLM's TP=4 shape:

| | |
|---|---|
| tensor pipe | **79.0% of peak** |
| throughput on rows it actually computes | **345 TFLOPS** |
| against cuBLAS bf16 on ideal square GEMMs | 417 TFLOPS, so **83%** |
| row padding (blocks rounded to 128) | 13% |
| net useful throughput | 299 TFLOPS |

79% of the tensor pipe, for a kernel that also decodes a 4-bit trellis and fuses
a Hadamard epilogue, is not a kernel with headroom in it. The only remaining
loss is the 13% of computed rows that are block padding, and **trading block
size for it makes things worse, not better** -- measured on rows actually
computed, block 128 / 64 / 32 give 345 / 289 / 237 TFLOPS while padding only
falls 13% / 13% / 7%. Tensor efficiency is lost faster than padding is saved.
A mixed-block scheme could in principle recover part of that 13%, which is 13%
of the 20% the MoE costs: under 3% of TTFT, for a change to both the kernel and
vLLM's block alignment. Not worth it.

An earlier version of this section claimed the MoE ran at ~100 TFLOPS and 25% of
SoL and was the dominant prefill cost. That figure came from timing **one expert
in isolation** with `exl3_linear` -- a 64-block launch on 188 SMs -- which is not
how it runs. Production batches all 288 experts into a single grid.

So the ranked prefill levers on *this* machine are: the interconnect, which is a
hardware property; then attention and the MoE at roughly equal weight, one at
34% of the card's GEMM rate and the other at 63%. The attention kernel has the
larger relative gap, and the neighbourhood search above says it is not reachable
by retiling.

**The indexer is 2%** -- a claim this README carried for a while, blamed for
long-context cost on the basis of TPOT at two context lengths, and wrong. Prefill
is nearly linear in context (10,270 tok/s at 8k against 9,874 at 24k), which a
quadratic scoring term would not allow.

### Measurements

Two things flatter a sparse-MLA benchmark, and both of them fooled this one
first. GLM's latent row is 1 KB per token, so an 8k-row cache is 8 MB against a
128 MB L2 and every read hits. And even against a large cache, replaying one
top-k list inside a CUDA graph makes the *selected* rows L2-resident after the
first pass. Measured that way this kernel looked like it was at 106% of the HBM
roofline at batch 16 and comfortably ahead of b12x. It is neither.

`bench/bench_mla_headtohead.py` uses a 1 GiB cache and a fresh selection for
every call in the graph. GLM-5.3-Flash's decode shape, 16 heads (TP=4),
topk 2048, head_dim 576 -- b12x refuses 512 outright (*"SM120 sparse MLA decode
requires the GLM_NSA contract (q_head_dim=576)"*), so the head-to-head is at the
padded width:

| batch | b12x (nvfp4) | ours, bf16 | ours, fp8 | | at head_dim 512 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 18.4 us | 8.3 us | **7.6 us** | 2.42x | 7.1 us |
| 4 | 19.5 us | 13.3 us | **10.6 us** | 1.84x | 9.7 us |
| 16 | 31.1 us | 31.6 us | **19.4 us** | 1.60x | 17.9 us |
| 32 | 56.2 us | 56.1 us | **31.9 us** | 1.76x | 27.9 us |

These are **cold**, and getting that right took a correction. The selection set
is now sized per shape so the rows it touches overrun L2 twice over; a fixed 20
selections leaves batch 1 warm (40 MB against a 128 MB L2) and understated it by
14%. It does not change batch 16 or 32, where 20 selections were already 755 MB
and well past the cache.

**Why cold is the regime that matters, and why the obvious argument for warm is
wrong.** A sequence's top-k list changes by about one row in 2048 per decode
step, so consecutive steps re-touch almost exactly the same rows -- which looks
like a strong argument that decode runs warm, and it is the argument this README
used to make. It is wrong, because row overlap is only half of what decides
residency. Between one layer's call and that same layer's next call, the whole
rest of the model streams through: gigabytes against tens of megabytes of L2,
turning it over a hundred times or more. Nothing survives, so the overlap buys
nothing. Modelled properly, warm, drifting and independent selections all
collapse onto one curve, and the difference is worth up to **1.9x at batch 16**
on this card -- with the optimum two chunk tiers away from where the warm
measurement puts it.

The cache is the whole cost here, so the way to go faster is to read less of
it. An e4m3 cache stores `k / kv_scale`, and **both matmuls are linear in that
scale, so it never touches an element**: it folds into the softmax scale for
`Q @ K^T` and into the merged output for `P @ V`. The widening to bf16 is exact
-- e4m3 carries three mantissa bits against bf16's seven and its 448 maximum is
far inside range. fp8 gives up cp.async, since values must be widened on the way
to shared, so that path reads global into registers, one buffer instead of two,
with the next tile prefetched into registers. That costs 4% at batch 1 (which is
latency-bound, not bandwidth-bound) and pays 1.3-1.8x everywhere else.

With it the kernel is ahead of b12x at every batch size while still reading
twice the bytes b12x does.

So: a large win at the batch sizes where latency matters, and parity at batch 16
and above, where both kernels are simply reading memory. At batch 32 this one
sustains 1351 GB/s of useful cache read against a 1461 GB/s stream copy on this
card, so there is little left to win there.

Getting from 0.93x to parity at large batch was one fix, and not in the
attention at all. The merge splits its 256 threads between output dims and the
split axis; at 11 splits, spreading over 32 split groups left two thirds of
every block idle and still paid for the cross-group reduce. Sizing the split
axis to the actual split count is worth 8% end to end at batch 32.

Batch 1 is a different story: 333 GB/s, nowhere near the ceiling. It cannot get
there, and it is worth being precise about why. Skipping the merge entirely
(wrong answers, timing only) gives 4.7 us, so the merge is 2.4 us of the 7.1 --
34% at batch 1, but only 8% at batch 32. Of that, roughly 0.9 us is the second
kernel launch itself: a trivial kernel replayed from a CUDA graph on this card
costs 0.92 us, and there are two of them.

That is the whole remaining structure. Filling 188 SMs needs roughly 190 key
splits, and flash-decoding writes a partial per split, so merge cost overtakes
the cache read long before the machine is full; the split count that balances
the two is 11-64 depending on batch, which is 176-352 blocks -- fewer than the
GPU has SMs. Nothing about that is fixable by making the inner loop faster.

The one thing that would fix it is merging splits without going through global
memory, and on this hardware that does not work. See below.

**Thread block clusters and distributed shared memory.** This is the structural
answer: a cluster of blocks covering consecutive key chunks merges its partials
in DSMEM, so only one partial per cluster reaches global and split-k parallelism
decouples from split-k merge cost. sm_120 supports it -- `clusterLaunch` is 1,
`map_shared_rank` returns correct data, and it survives CUDA graph capture, all
verified, and the implementation passed 108 configurations. It is also **2 to 3
times slower**. Removing just the DSMEM reduction tree while keeping every
cluster barrier brings it back to within 1.2x, so the barriers and the scheduling
constraint are cheap and the tree is not: 66 KB of peer reads per block costs
about 8 us, roughly 40x the rate of local shared memory on the same chip.
Consumer Blackwell implements the cluster programming model without the fast
interconnect that makes it worth using on datacenter parts.

The tile geometry is a local optimum, and the whole neighbourhood was measured.
Prefill runs at ~140 TFLOPS against this card's 417, with the tensor pipe at
30%, so the question is what the other 70% waits for. Every neighbour is worse,
each for a different reason:

| variant | result | why |
|---|---|---|
| 8 warps, 32-key tile, **one** buffer | 1.8x slower | twice the mma between barriers, but losing the `cp.async` prefetch costs more than the barriers save |
| **16 warps**, 16-key tile | 2.2x slower | halves per-thread accumulators and held Q fragments, so the compiler lands at **61 registers instead of 122** and occupancy doubles, **33% -> 66%** of peak warps. **The tensor pipe does not move off 30%.** |
| 8 warps, 32-key tile, two buffers | 2.5x slower | keeps the prefetch and doubles mma per warp per barrier, but a 32-key tile forces the k-slices to two, so each warp holds 16 Q fragments -- 64 registers -- and the register file gives out |
| 16 warps, 32-key tile | declined by the autotuner at every size | -- |

The 16-warp row is the informative one: **occupancy is not what binds this
kernel.** Doubling resident warps changed nothing, so the earlier reading in
this README -- that two blocks per SM was the ceiling and more warps would help
-- was wrong. Halving the work each warp does between the same four barriers
costs more than the extra warps return.

The two knobs that would raise mma-per-barrier both raise register pressure
through the held Q fragments; the one that lowers register pressure lowers work
per barrier instead. Moving past 30% needs the ratio of mma to
softmax-and-staging work *inside* a tile to change, which is a different kernel
rather than a different tiling of this one.

One thing that did work, from the same investigation: the selection list used to
be copied into shared a whole chunk at a time, which is 8 KB at chunk 2048 --
exactly enough to push a prefill block from 43 to 50.6 KB and from two resident
blocks per SM down to one. A 1 KB rolling slab with one tile of lookahead costs
one barrier every sixteen tiles and restores it, worth 12% at head_dim 576
(2365 -> 2086 us at 4096 rows). head_dim 512, which is what GLM uses, was
already under the cliff and does not move.

Things that did not work, all reverted:

* **Register prefetch instead of a second shared K buffer**, to trade 18 KB of
  shared for 18 registers and go from two resident blocks to four. Shared did
  drop to 24 KB, but registers went 63 -> 127 and became the limiter instead, so
  occupancy was unchanged. It would not have helped anyway: at the tuned split
  count the grid is 176-352 blocks against 188 SMs, so most SMs hold one block
  and per-SM occupancy is not what is binding.

* `cp.async.cg` instead of `.ca` to keep the streamed cache out of L1. No change
  at batch 16, 3% worse at batch 32.
* An L2 prefetch two tiles ahead, to raise memory-level parallelism without
  spending the shared memory a third buffer would cost. 2% worse.
* Sorting the selection so the gather walks the cache in order. Exactly no
  difference -- consecutive selected rows are still hundreds of rows apart, so
  there is no DRAM page to reuse either way.

And four in the kernel itself:

* **Naive vectorization of the V load.** Giving each lane a contiguous 16-dim
  slice puts lanes 32 bytes apart and reconflicts the banks. The conflict-free
  pattern is consecutive lanes on consecutive 16-byte chunks.
* **`&int4` to read a loaded vector as bf16.** Taking the address spills it to
  local memory. bf16 to fp32 is a 16-bit shift; do that instead.
* **Double buffering the obvious way**, before Q moved to registers: 60 KB of
  shared drops the SM to one block and costs more than the prefetch saves.
* **Splitting heads across blocks** as the *only* source of parallelism, which
  was right when the inner loop was an FMA chain. The mma tile is 16 heads wide,
  so a narrower group wastes half of every instruction -- but at batch 1, where
  the kernel is latency-bound rather than bandwidth-bound, that waste is cheaper
  than idle SMs, so the autotuner still keeps a half-group shape and picks it
  there (3%).

### Serving GLM-5.3-Flash on it

Running this on **DGX Sparks** instead: **[docs/dgx-spark-glm53.md](docs/dgx-spark-glm53.md)**,
which now carries measured GB10 numbers -- the MoE kernel at 3.3-4.2x over bf16
and 90-91% of that machine's bandwidth, sparse-MLA at 95-96%, fp8 KV worth
1.5-1.9x there. No separate kernel path is needed for sm_121; per-device tuning
is, and `bench/calibrate.py` produces it.
GB10 is the other machine these kernels were written for -- no `tcgen05`, 99 KB
of shared memory, warp-level `mma` only -- so they build for sm_121 from the
same source. That guide covers sizing across two nodes, the aarch64 image
problem, why bytes rather than TFLOPS are the lever on a 218 GB/s machine, and
an honest comparison against the existing 2x Spark kernel work. It is **not**
tested by me; every hardware-specific claim in it is cited.


The kernel and backend were run end to end on GLM-5.3-Flash (45 layers, 288
experts, EXL3 4-bit routed experts) across 4x RTX PRO 6000, TP=4, with this
plugin providing both the EXL3 quantization and the attention:

```
--attention-backend CUSTOM --kv-cache-dtype auto --tensor-parallel-size 4
```

All four workers log `Using AttentionBackendEnum.CUSTOM backend`, the model
generates coherently, and the KV cache reports 1.8M tokens -- a bf16 512-wide
latent, not the packed 656-byte record. `docker/Dockerfile.sparse-mla` builds
the plugin into a base image that carries a vLLM with the model definition;
`Glm5Next*` is in no released vLLM, so a stock nightly cannot serve this model
whatever the backend.

Measured against b12x on **the same image, the same weights, the same
everything but the attention backend and its cache dtype** (`vllm bench serve`,
`--ignore-eos`, output token throughput):

**8000 in / 1000 out**, the shape most agent workloads look like:

| conc | TTFT ours | TTFT b12x | out tok/s ours | out tok/s b12x | TPOT ours | TPOT b12x |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.78 s | 0.79 s | 100.8 | 101.6 | 9.15 ms | 9.06 ms |
| 2 | 1.16 s | 1.16 s | 161.9 | 162.6 | 11.20 | 11.15 |
| 4 | 1.91 s | 1.83 s | 263.3 | 265.4 | 13.28 | 13.24 |
| 8 | 2.91 s | 2.99 s | 402.0 | 397.1 | 16.99 | 17.15 |
| 16 | 4.65 s | 4.67 s | 526.2 | 523.9 | 25.73 | 25.85 |

**24k in / 256 out**:

| conc | TTFT ours | TTFT b12x | TPOT ours | TPOT b12x |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2.49 s | 2.51 s | 9.28 ms | 9.27 ms |
| 4 | 6.11 s | 6.33 s | 24.44 ms | 24.27 ms |
| 8 | 9.99 s | 9.75 s | 80.17 ms | 80.29 ms |

So the `CUSTOM` backend is level with b12x end to end, on our own kernels
throughout. Getting there took the prefill work above: before it, TTFT at
8k/1000 was 1.38 s against b12x's 0.79, and TPOT at 24k/c=4 was 30.2 ms against
24.3. **Prefill is 1.77x faster than it was**, which is more than the 1.22x the
kernel itself gained -- the rest was the autotuner, which had been re-searching
from scratch for every distinct prefill chunk size.

That last point corrects something this README previously claimed. Measuring
TPOT at 512 tokens of context against 24k and attributing the difference to the
DSA indexer was wrong: with chunked prefill those decode steps carry prefill
chunks from other requests in the batch, so most of what grows with context is
prefill, not indexing. Making prefill 1.77x faster moved that "decode" number
19%, which is not something an indexer theory predicts.

An fp8 cache (`--kv-cache-dtype fp8`) also serves correctly and doubles KV
capacity, 1.8M tokens to 3.0M. It changes the end-to-end numbers very little,
which is the honest reading of a kernel that is already fast enough not to be
the bottleneck: 45 layers of it is 0.33 ms of a token at batch 1.

One caveat on the base image: roughly half the time, startup dies during CUDA
graph capture with an illegal address inside a TVM kernel (grid 4x1x1, block
96x1x1 -- flashinfer/b12x territory, reproduced with b12x's own backend
selected). Identical flags start fine on retry.

## MoE notes

Two things worth knowing if you touch this path:

* vLLM's MoE weight loader decides `is_fused = loaded_weight.dim() == 3`, i.e. it
  treats any 3-D tensor as *all experts stacked*. An EXL3 trellis is genuinely
  3-D **per expert**, so that heuristic slices it apart on the wrong axis, and
  there is no hook before the decision. This module therefore installs its own
  `load_weights`.
* `moe_align_block_size` marks blocks belonging to no expert with `-1`, and those
  appear inside the live row range, not only in the tail. Both MoE kernels skip
  them explicitly; without that the trellis pointer goes negative and the launch
  faults.

Padding each expert's run up to a whole block wastes rows when the batch is small
and the expert count large: with 256 experts and 8 routed, live rows are 20-32x
the useful rows below 32 tokens. That cost is **sublinear but not free** --
measured by varying the block size on Qwen3.5-35B-A3B:

| block | c=1 | c=8 | c=32 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 186 tok/s | 1173 | 2684 |
| 32 | 172 (0.92x) | 1031 (0.88x) | 2294 (0.85x) |
| 64 | 158 (0.85x) | 848 (0.72x) | 1716 (0.64x) |
| 128 | 123 (0.66x) | 610 (0.52x) | 1161 (0.43x) |

Quadrupling the block costs ~2x, not ~4x, because weight traffic is unchanged
(the same experts are read either way) -- the surplus is MMA work on a
memory-bound kernel. But it is real, so the block size drops to 16 when there are
few tokens per expert. **16 is the floor**: `mma.m16n8k16` computes 16 rows at a
time, so no finer alignment is expressible.

It costs no VRAM. The padded buffers are transient and reused by the caching
allocator: peak activation is 1.04 GiB for the MoE model against 1.01 GiB for the
dense one, and weights land at 17.79 GiB against a 19.58 GiB checkpoint.

## Loading into a dim vLLM has padded

vLLM pads dims that do not divide the tensor-parallel size -- the vocabulary, and
the head count when a model's heads do not split evenly. EXL3 weights cannot be
zero-extended, since a trellis is not a dense tensor, but they do not have to be:
`svh` scales elementwise *after* the output Hadamard, so zeroing it on the pad
makes those columns exactly zero whatever the trellis behind them holds. The
decoder is total -- all 65,536 codes decode finite in every codebook, checked
exhaustively -- so an uninitialised pad cannot turn that zero into a NaN.

**The pad must be whole 128-column Hadamard blocks.** The block mixes across its
columns before `svh` is applied, so a straddling pad corrupts the real columns
beside it rather than merely being zero itself. Real output must end on a
boundary and the padded total must be whole blocks; both are checked per rank,
and the error says which failed and by how much. In practice that means padding
constants move from `lcm(64, tp)` to `lcm(128, tp)`.

A padded *input* dim is the mirror case: the producing layer's pad columns are
already exact zeros, so those input positions carry zeros and `suh` there cannot
reach the output -- but the row-parallel load must copy what exists and zero the
rest rather than narrowing past the end of the checkpoint.

Measured by @NNNtrance (#5) on three GB10 nodes, GLM-5.3-Flash at TP=3 with 64
heads padded to 66, `turboderp/GLM-5.3-Flash-exl3` 4.05bpw full scope against a
same-day control quantising only the routed experts:

| | full scope | routed experts only | |
|---|---|---|---|
| single stream | 75.91 tok/s | 62.39 | **+21.7%** |
| 8-way aggregate | 197.20 | 175.37 | +12.5% |
| TTFT single stream | 0.280 s | 0.344 | -18.6% |
| KV cache | 5,165,289 tok | 4,696,969 | **+10.0%** |
| memory per rank | 58.3-59.1 GiB | 62.1-62.4 | -3.4 GiB |
| MMLU (57 x 35) | 86.5 +/- 0.7 | 86.4 +/- 0.7 | equal |
| draft acceptance | 61.9% | 64.4% | -2.4 pt |

A post-load audit found 285 padded EXL3 sites on the rank that owns the padding,
every pad a whole number of blocks and exactly zero. The step-time arithmetic
isolates it: 88.2 -> 70.3 ms per decode step, and tokens per accepted step fell
3%, which multiplies out to the +21.7% measured.

Quantising the dense path is worth about 18 ms of every decode step there. It is
also *smaller*: the full-scope checkpoint loads 21% faster and leaves 3.4 GiB
more per rank, because 4-bit attention and a 6-bit head are less than bf16 ones.

## Two things chased and settled

**The sparse-indexer logits reservation does not bind at ordinary context.**
vLLM reserves `max(worst_decode_tokens * max_model_len * 4,
VLLM_SPARSE_INDEXER_MAX_LOGITS_MB)` during memory profiling, and the recipe in
docs/related-work.md reports right-sizing it returning ~26% of the KV pool. That
is at 1M context, where the reservation runs to gigabytes. At 32k it is 2 MiB of
decode logits against a 512 MiB flat cap, and the cap never raises the profiler's
peak above what the weights and activations already set: measured, the KV pool is
5,066,556 tokens at both `VLLM_SPARSE_INDEXER_MAX_LOGITS_MB=512` (default) and
`=256`, byte for byte, with throughput unchanged. Worth revisiting only if
serving very long context.

**The KV page size is not costing anything here, but it would with a draft.**
`_largest_kernel_block_within` returns the *smallest* block a backend advertises
whenever there is no page budget, and this backend advertises `[64, 256]`, so the
MLA group is handed 64. Forcing 256 measures slightly worse -- 5,024,972 KV
tokens against 5,066,556, throughput unchanged -- so there is nothing to recover.

That is worth recording because it is *not* what the same rule does to a
speculative-decoding draft. On GB10 (#2) the draft's sliding-window group never
reaches `unify`, takes its backend's smallest block of 16, and then accounts for
53% of the blocks-per-request divisor while holding 0.6% of the memory; giving
that group a 256-token page returned 82% more KV pool, +6% throughput at
concurrency 8 and 20-30% off TTFT. We see none of that because we run no draft
group. If speculative decoding is ever enabled here, check `blocks per request`
in the boot log before anything else. Note also that matching the target's MLA
page is the wrong instinct: at 3,328 their pool fell 7% *below* the 16 baseline.

**The intermittent startup failure is not in this plugin.** Roughly half of
server starts die during warm-up with
`tvm.error.InternalError: CUDALaunch Error: CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`. The
traceback is `vllm/model_executor/layers/mhc.py` -> `kernels/mhc/tilelang.py`
-> a TileLang JIT kernel -> TVM's CUDA module: no frame of this plugin appears
in it, and the MHC layer is not something we provide or call.

Two hypotheses were checked and rejected. TileLang's kernel cache guards itself
with `threading.Lock`, which does nothing across vLLM's four TP worker
*processes* -- but its publish step is atomic (`os.replace` / `os.rename`, with
the duplicate-compile collision handled), so a torn artifact is not the
mechanism. And an illegal address at kernel *launch* rather than at module load
points at a fault inside the kernel rather than a corrupt one.

There is no switch: `HAS_TILELANG_MHC` is true whenever `tilelang` imports, and
the `forward_native` fallback is only reachable by making the package
unimportable. `has_tilelang()` already carries a workaround for tilelang's
`libcudart_stub.so` shadowing the real cudart and breaking flashinfer's
all-reduce, so this path is known-fragile in these images. Until it is fixed
upstream, retry the start; it is not a persistent failure.

## Attribution

The trellis bit packing, the procedural codebook and the mma fragment layout are
part of the EXL3 on-disk format and follow ExLlamaV3 (MIT, (c) 2025 Turboderp);
those headers are vendored with per-file attribution in `cuda_exl3/csrc/`, and
**[NOTICE](NOTICE)** reproduces the licence in full along with everything else
this project borrows from. The GEMM tiling, split-k, fused epilogue, shard map,
the sparse-MLA kernel and the vLLM integration are new.

Nothing else is vendored. The plugin subclasses vLLM's interfaces (Apache 2.0)
without copying its source, and the 2x DGX Spark kit that
`bench/bench_vs_spark_fat_gemm.py` measures against is built from a checkout the
user supplies rather than redistributed here.

Two other MIT-licensed projects run EXL3 GLM-5.3-Flash on DGX Sparks --
`MiaAI-Lab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks` and `vcruz305/vllm-exl3`. No code
is taken from either. One idea is: `vcruz305/vllm-exl3`'s `p2b_moe.cu` is where
the observation came from that MoE decode routes about one row to each expert,
so a 16-row tile is mostly padding -- which is what `f4987cf` acts on, by a
different mechanism than theirs. **[docs/related-work.md](docs/related-work.md)**
records what each project does, what was taken, what was measured and rejected,
and what this plugin already had.

## Where the time goes

Profiled with the torch profiler and `ncu` (`bench/profile_workload.py`), 8k
context on one GPU:

* **Prefill is 82% this GEMM**, running at ~292 TFLOPS -- about 71% of the fp16
  compute peak, while reading 2.9x fewer bytes.

  This used to say that was "roughly what cuBLAS achieves on the same shapes".
  It is not, and the claim is withdrawn. Measured at 4096x4096 and 4096x11008,
  the GEMM alone against `torch.matmul` bf16 on the same shapes:

  | bits | M | this GEMM | cuBLAS | |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 4 | 2048 | 290 TFLOPS | 352 | 1.22x slower |
  | 4 | 8192 | 324 | 370 | 1.14x |
  | 6 | 2048 | 277 | 353 | 1.27x |
  | 6 | 8192 | 320 | 388 | 1.21x |

  Adding the input transform, the whole dense path against `torch.matmul` bf16
  on the same shapes, **with the weights rotated so the working set overruns L2**
  (which is what a real step does -- every layer's weights come from DRAM once):

  | K x N | M=8 | M=64 | M=256 | M=2048 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 4096 x 4096 | **0.68** | **0.71** | 1.37 | 1.37 |
  | 4096 x 11008 | **0.45** | **0.57** | 1.31 | 1.33 |

  Ratio exl3/bf16; below 1.0 the trellis wins. **At decode it wins by 1.5-2.2x**
  -- bandwidth-bound, and 4-6 bits of weight beat 16 -- and loses by ~1.35x above
  about M=256, where the layer turns compute-bound and cuBLAS's tensor-core
  efficiency dominates. The crossover is between M=64 and M=256.

  There is a second limit below the crossover, in the other direction. A module
  small enough that its weights are not the cost gains nothing from having fewer
  of them: measured on GB10 (#5), GLM-5.3-Flash's KDA gating arms are 0.72 MB per
  rank at TP=3, about 3 us of traffic against a launch, input transform and
  trellis-decode setup of several times that. They are fixed-cost-bound, so 4-bit
  weights save bytes that were never being paid for, and the trellis measures
  1.6-1.8x *slower* than bf16 there even with a cold cache. The whole family is
  0.85 ms of a 72.5 ms decode step, so it does not matter -- but it is why a
  checkpoint that leaves small modules in bf16 is not leaving anything on the
  table. `kv_b_proj` is the exception that would win (0.39x cold) and needs a
  per-head batched kernel that does not exist.

  The L2 caveat is not incidental. Timing one weight tensor repeatedly keeps it
  resident and erases the whole effect: measured that way the same M=8 points
  read 1.13 and 0.97 instead of 0.68 and 0.45, i.e. roughly parity instead of a
  2x win. A 6-bit 4096x4096 weight is 12.6 MB and its bf16 twin is 33.5 MB, so on
  a 128 MiB L2 both stay cached and neither pays for what it reads. Any benchmark
  of a quantized GEMM has to defeat that or it measures the wrong thing.

  That matters for a full-scope checkpoint, where attention and the head are
  EXL3 too: it is a large decode win and a small prefill loss. Measured on GB10
  (#5), the dense stage went -21.0 ms at decode and +17.3 ms at a 1792-token
  prefill chunk. If a deployment is prefill-dominated, dense EXL3 is the wrong
  trade and only the routed experts should be quantized.
* **Decode at 8k context** (c=16) splits ~60% GEMM, ~25% attention, ~8% GDN. The
  GEMM there is at 84-98% of the memory-bandwidth limit.

`ncu` at prefill sizes: tensor pipe 77.8% active, occupancy 2 blocks/SM
(register-bound at 99 registers), and the dominant stall is `math_pipe_throttle`
-- the trellis dequant competes with MMA for issue slots. This is structural:
Marlin's int4 dequant is 4 instructions for 8 weights (two `lop3`, an `hsub2`
and an `hfma2`), while EXL3's procedural trellis codebook needs ~52 for 8 --
**13x more ALU work per weight**. Marlin can be MMA-bound; this kernel cannot.

The one thing worth stealing from Marlin *was* its tile shape. It uses BK=64 so
an A row is exactly 128 B = 32 banks, which makes an 8-way XOR swizzle
conflict-free with no padding (`transform_a`, `... ^ (row % 8)`). This kernel
originally used BK=32, where a 64 B row leaves only 4 columns to permute and no
XOR can fix it -- hence the stride padding, which cost a pipeline stage. Adopting
BK=64 across all tiers was worth **10-26%** (tensor pipe 70.4% -> 77.8%) and
raised the small-batch shapes to 85-112% of the memory bound.

That large L2 also mis-calibrated the split-k heuristic. Its cost is an extra
read-modify-write of the fp32 accumulator, which the original heuristic charged
against HBM weight bytes -- but at m<=256 that accumulator is only a few MB and
stays in L2, so it is far cheaper than modelled. Discounting it when it fits
(`CUDA_EXL3_L2_GAIN`, default 2) unblocked split-k exactly where the kernel is
block-starved, and was worth up to **1.5x** in the m=16..256 range (`up_proj`
m=32: 59.4 -> 39.2 us). It is a discount, not a bypass -- treating the traffic as
free over-splits and regresses (`down_proj` m=128 went 101 -> 121 us).

Seven things were tried and rejected against measurement:

* **Hoisting the dequant's index arithmetic** out of the inner loop. `dq4`
  recomputes bit indices per call including a `% 48` (non-power-of-two, so a
  magic-multiply sequence), and those depend only on the lane. Precomputing them
  changed `smsp__inst_executed` by exactly zero instructions -- ptxas was already
  hoisting all of it. The ~74 instructions per 8 weights are real dequant work,
  not addressing overhead.

* A wider warp tile (WARP_N=32) at BM=128, re-evaluated after the bank-conflict
  fix changed the ldsm/dequant balance. Consistently ~3% slower; reverted.
* The cheaper 8-wide decode path for 6-bit. It does not apply: at the lane*8
  alignment the 58-bit window crosses three 32-bit words, so two loads cannot
  cover it. ExLlamaV3's `dq4` x2 for 6 bits is correct.

* **fp16 accumulation** (`CUDA_EXL3_FP16_ACC=1`, opt-in, off by default). Halving
  the accumulator registers affords BM=256 and so twice the MMA work per
  dequantized weight -- the obvious lever against the issue pressure above. It
  does not pay off: BM=256 needs 145 registers and 69 KB of shared, which drops
  occupancy to 1 block/SM and cancels the gain (8192-row `q_proj` 3518 -> 3599 us;
  512-row `down_proj` regressed 403 -> 694 us). Relative error rose 8-16x at the
  same time (3.5e-4 -> 2.6e-3, and 4.9e-3 on `down_proj`, where k=17408 gives the
  most accumulation steps). Left in as a flag so the result does not get
  re-derived. Note there is no bf16 accumulator to try instead -- bf16 mma inputs
  always accumulate to fp32.

* **Fusing the split-k epilogue into the GEMM.** With split-k on, the Hadamard
  epilogue is a second kernel launch, and at low concurrency turning split-k off
  entirely is roughly a wash (MoE decode, tok/s: c=1 205.2 vs 202.8, c=8 1240.5
  vs 1245.6, c=32 3244.7 vs 3182.8) -- the launch was eating the parallelism the
  split buys. The obvious fix is a counter-based epilogue: each block bumps a
  per-tile atomic after its partials land, and the last split to arrive owns the
  Hadamard. Implemented (`__threadfence()`, `atomicAdd` on a tile counter,
  partials re-read through L2 with `__ldcg`) and clearly worse: `q_proj` m=32
  33.6 -> 46.4 us, m=64 49.3 -> 69.8, `up_proj` m=16 36.3 -> 51.4. The fence on
  every split block plus the scattered, poorly-parallelised finalisation cost
  more than the launch they save. A kernel boundary is simply a cheaper
  grid-wide barrier than one built by hand.

* **Split-k for the MoE expert gemm** (`CUDA_EXL3_MOE_ACC_MAX_ELEMS`, off by
  default). The expert gemm is block-starved at low concurrency -- c=1 with
  top_k=8 gives 8 padded row-blocks, so w13 launches ~96 blocks against 188 SMs
  -- and splitting k is a real kernel win (rows=512, block_m=32: 33.0 -> 27.5 us,
  -17%). It does not survive end to end: splitting adds an epilogue launch per
  gemm per layer, ~96 extra kernels per decode step, which costs more than the
  parallelism buys (8k in / 1k out, tok/s: c=8 742.9 -> 712.8, c=32
  1211.6 -> 1196.2, c=1 and c=64 a wash). This is the same wall the fused
  epilogue hit from the other side. Kept behind the knob, and covered by tests
  so it cannot rot, because the trade-off is hardware-dependent.

* **Fusing the input transform into the gemm prologue.** At decode `exl3_had_in`
  is ~2.3 us to move ~100 KB -- about 0.06 us of actual traffic -- and it is 4.7%
  of decode GPU time across ~160 launches per step. Since the gemm re-reads A
  once per n-block either way, building A in the prologue looked free: same
  traffic, minus a launch and a global round trip. Implemented with BK=128, so a
  pipeline stage is exactly one Hadamard block, writing straight into the swizzled
  shared layout (`had128_warp_in_swz`). Correct to 8.4e-5 across 54 shape/dtype
  combinations, and much slower: `q_proj` m=16 24.8 -> 33.0 us, m=32 33.0 -> 63.7,
  `up_proj` m=32 41.2 -> 83.5. The traffic argument was right and irrelevant. What
  it missed is that the A copy is a `cp.async` that overlaps with the previous
  stage's mma, while the fused version is a synchronous chain of warp shuffles
  sitting on the pipeline's critical path -- and it runs once per n-block (96x for
  `q_proj`) instead of once per layer. A separate kernel does the transform once
  and lets `cp.async` hide the read; that is worth more than the launch it costs.

At large batch the kernel now runs at **81% of peak MMA throughput**, issuing 6.5
non-MMA instructions per MMA -- 827M ALU+FMA against 178M tensor instructions at
m=4096. That ratio is set by the format: a procedural trellis codebook costs
~74 instructions per 8 weights where an int4 LUT costs 4. Issue slots are only
~33% occupied, so the limit is the math pipes competing with the tensor pipe,
not instruction bandwidth.

One thing tuning *did* still find: the best block-M is shape-dependent, not just
batch-dependent. At m=128, `up_proj` (n=17408) is 16% faster with BM=64 while
`q_proj` (n=12288) prefers BM=128 -- no static rule captures both. The kernel now
times the BM tiers once per distinct shape and caches the winner (skipped during
CUDA graph capture, which cannot tolerate the syncs). That is worth ~7-10% in the
m=128..256 range.

The same argument then applies to the split factor, which `pick_split` picks from
a cost model. Block size and split interact -- a bigger tile means fewer blocks,
so more splitting is needed to fill the machine -- yet the split used to be
computed once from the *heuristic* BM and then paired with whatever BM the tuner
chose. Recomputing it per candidate, and letting the tuner also try one step
either side of the model's answer (`base/2`, `base`, `base*2`), is worth a
further 5-14% in the same band, with no shape regressing:

| shape | m=32 | m=128 | m=256 | m=512 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `q_proj` | 35.0 -> 33.0 | 95.1 -> 88.2 | 166.1 -> 152.2 | -- |
| `up_proj` | 41.1 -> 39.3 | 113.5 -> 106.7 | 184.7 -> 168.8 | -- |
| `down_proj` | 39.1 -> 37.1 | 114.9 -> 98.4 | 198.1 -> 179.2 | 371.3 -> 339.4 |

The cost model is still what graph capture falls back on, so the tuner's answer
has to be cached during eager warm-up to reach captured decode.

Beating it further needs a different structure, not tuning. The honest options
are: decode the trellis into shared once per block and stream several M tiles
past it (needs the accumulators for those tiles to live somewhere, which is the
same register wall fp16 accumulation hit); or low-precision tensor cores, which
as measured above would need a codebook designed to decode into fp8/nvfp4 -- a
format change, not a kernel change.
